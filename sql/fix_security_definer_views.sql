-- üîí SECURITY FIX: Replace SECURITY DEFINER views with SECURITY INVOKER
-- =================================================================
-- Date: 2025-07-12
-- Issue: Supabase security advisory - SECURITY DEFINER views bypass RLS
-- Solution: Recreate views with security_invoker = true
-- =================================================================

-- =================================================================
-- üìä FIX USER_STATS VIEW
-- =================================================================

-- Drop existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.user_stats CASCADE;

-- Recreate with SECURITY INVOKER (respects RLS policies)
CREATE VIEW public.user_stats 
WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.email,
    p.full_name,
    uc.credits,
    COUNT(ap.id) as total_projects,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ap.status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed_projects,
    COALESCE(SUM(ul.credits_used), 0) as total_credits_used,
    p.created_at as user_since

-- üìã FIX RECENT_ACTIVITY VIEW
-- =================================================================

-- Drop existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.recent_activity CASCADE;

-- Recreate with SECURITY INVOKER (respects RLS policies)
CREATE VIEW public.recent_activity 
WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
SELECT 
    ul.user_id,
    ul.action,
    ul.credits_used,
    ul.metadata,
    ul.created_at,

-- üí≥ FIX STRIPE_PAYMENT_ANALYTICS VIEW
-- =================================================================

-- Drop existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.stripe_payment_analytics CASCADE;

-- Recreate with SECURITY INVOKER (respects RLS policies)
CREATE VIEW public.stripe_payment_analytics 
WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', ct.created_at) as payment_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ct.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_payments,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ct.status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed_payments,

FROM public.credit_transactions ct
WHERE ct.transaction_type = 'purchase' 
    AND ct.stripe_session_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', ct.created_at)

-- Re-grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT ON public.stripe_payment_analytics TO service_role;

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON VIEW public.stripe_payment_analytics IS 'Analytics view for Stripe payment performance (service role only) - respects RLS policies';

-- =================================================================
-- ‚úÖ VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- =================================================================

-- You can run these queries to verify the views are working correctly:
-- SELECT * FROM public.user_stats LIMIT 5;
-- SELECT * FROM public.recent_activity LIMIT 5;
-- SELECT * FROM public.stripe_payment_analytics LIMIT 5;

-- =================================================================
-- üìù NOTES
-- =================================================================
-- 1. SECURITY INVOKER means views execute with the permissions of the calling user
-- 2. This ensures RLS policies are properly enforced
-- 3. No impact on application functionality as these views are not currently used
-- 4. Service role still has access to stripe_payment_analytics for backend operations
