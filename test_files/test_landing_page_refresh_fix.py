Landing Page Refresh Navigation Fix

This test documents the fix applied for the issue where refreshing the landing page
while authenticated would automatically redirect the user to the app page, breaking
the user's intended page choice and causing authentication issues.

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- User refreshes landing page (/) while authenticated
- Auth module session restoration triggers automatic navigation
- User gets redirected to app page (/app) against their will
- This breaks the user experience and causes authentication confusion

ROOT CAUSE:
- Auth module's handleAuthSuccess() method had aggressive navigation logic
- Both SIGNED_IN and INITIAL_SESSION events could trigger unwanted navigation
- No distinction between actual login vs session restoration during page refresh
- Landing page user choice wasn't respected during authentication recovery

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Modified auth.js handleAuthSuccess() method to detect page refresh scenarios
- Added explicit protection for landing page during session restoration
- Enhanced INITIAL_SESSION handling to respect current page choice
- Improved SIGNED_IN event to detect and prevent refresh-based navigation

FILES MODIFIED:
- frontend/js/modules/auth.js: Enhanced navigation logic in handleAuthSuccess()

BEFORE (Problematic Behavior):
1. User on landing page while authenticated
2. User refreshes page (F5 or browser refresh)
3. Session restoration triggers SIGNED_IN or INITIAL_SESSION event
4. Auth module automatically navigates to '/app'
5. User ends up on app page instead of intended landing page

AFTER (Fixed Behavior):
1. User on landing page while authenticated  
2. User refreshes page (F5 or browser refresh)
3. Session restoration detects current page is '/'
4. Auth module respects user's page choice and stays on landing
5. User remains on landing page as intended

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

```javascript
// Enhanced SIGNED_IN event handling
if (authEvent === 'SIGNED_IN') {
    const isPageRefresh = !document.referrer || document.referrer === window.location.href;
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    
    if (isPageRefresh && currentPath === '/') {
        // CRITICAL FIX: Don't navigate away from landing page during refresh
        console.log('ðŸš« Preventing navigation from landing page during refresh');
        console.log('âœ… User chose to be on landing page, respecting their choice');
    } else {
        // Normal navigation logic for actual logins
    }
}

// Enhanced INITIAL_SESSION event handling  
} else if (authEvent === 'INITIAL_SESSION') {
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    console.log(`ðŸ”„ Session restored on ${currentPath}, staying on current page`);
    
    // Users should stay on whatever page they refreshed
    if (currentPath === '/') {
        console.log('âœ… Staying on landing page during session restore');
    }
}
```

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
âœ… Landing page refresh keeps user on landing page
âœ… App page refresh keeps user on app page  
âœ… Auth page refresh works normally
âœ… Google OAuth flows still work correctly
âœ… Normal login navigation still works
âœ… No authentication state confusion

PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
- Minimal performance impact
- Prevents unnecessary page navigation
- Improves user experience consistency
- Reduces authentication state confusion

DEBUG VALIDATION:
After fix, refreshing landing page should show console logs:
- "ðŸ”„ Session restored on /, staying on current page"
- "âœ… Staying on landing page during session restore"
- Should NOT see: Navigation to /app messages
