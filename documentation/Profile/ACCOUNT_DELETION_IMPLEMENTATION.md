# Account Deletion Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a secure account deletion feature that allows users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data from the AudioBook Organizer platform.

## Implementation Date
July 13, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/auth/account`
- **Location**: `backend/routes/auth_routes.py` (lines 675-825)
- **Security Features**:
  - Requires authentication via `@require_auth` decorator
  - Password verification before deletion
  - Confirmation text must be "DELETE"
  - Rate limiting: Uses standard auth rate limits
  - Comprehensive error handling
- **Implementation Status**: ✅ Fully functional and tested

### 2. File Cleanup System
- **Function**: `cleanup_user_files(user_id, file_paths)`
- **Location**: `backend/utils/file_cleanup.py` (lines 112-174)
- **Features**:
  - Deletes all files from database file_paths list
  - Pattern matching for files containing user_id
  - Graceful handling of missing files
  - Returns count of successfully deleted files
  - **Automatic cleanup - no manual intervention needed**

### 3. Frontend UI Components

#### Profile Modal Enhancement
- **Location**: `frontend/js/modules/profileModal.js`
- **New Features**:
  - "Delete Account" section in Settings tab (lines 416-437)
  - Red "Delete Account" button
  - Shows current credit balance in warning
  - Lists all data to be deleted

#### Delete Account Dialog
- **Method**: `showDeleteAccountDialog()` (lines 655-767)
- **Features**:
  - Modal overlay with higher z-index
  - Password input field
  - "Type DELETE" confirmation field
  - Clear warning messages
  - Loading states during deletion

#### Account Deletion Handler
- **Method**: `handleAccountDeletion()` (lines 785-820)
- **Features**:
  - Sends DELETE request to API
  - Clears local/session storage on success
  - Shows success message
  - Redirects to landing page with `?deleted=true` parameter

### 4. CSS Styling
- **Location**: `frontend/css/profile-modal.css` (lines 671-797)
- **Styles Added**:
  - `.danger-zone`: Subtle red-bordered section
  - `.btn-danger`: Red delete button
  - `.delete-account-modal`: Confirmation dialog styles
  - Theme-aware colors for light/dark mode

## Data Deletion Scope

### Database Tables
The implementation deletes data from all accessible tables:
- `profiles` (user profile data)
- `user_credits` (credit balance)
- `audiobook_projects` (all projects)
- `file_uploads` (file metadata)
- `usage_logs` (usage history)
- `auth.users` (if admin access available)

Note: Due to Supabase's protection of the auth.users table, the auth record may persist but the user will be unable to access the account since all associated data is deleted.

### File System
- Audio files in `uploads` folder (automatically deleted)
- Files identified by database records
- Files matching user_id pattern
- **No manual cleanup required**

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication Required**
   - Must be logged in to access endpoint
   - User can only delete their own account

2. **Password Verification**
   - Current password required
   - Verified via Supabase auth

3. **Confirmation Text**
   - Must type "DELETE" exactly
   - Case-sensitive validation

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Max 3 attempts per hour
   - Prevents brute force attempts

5. **Audit Logging**
   - All deletion attempts logged
   - Success/failure tracking

## User Experience Flow

1. User navigates to Profile → Settings tab
2. Scrolls to "Delete Account" section
3. Clicks red "Delete Account" button
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User enters password and types "DELETE"
6. If password is wrong:
   - Red error message appears below password field
   - NO loading overlay shown
   - User can immediately try again
7. If "DELETE" is not typed correctly:
   - Red error message appears below confirmation field
   - NO loading overlay shown
8. If all validation passes:
   - Loading overlay shows "Processing account deletion..."
   - Account data is deleted
9. User sees success message in modal
10. Redirected to landing page after 2 seconds
11. Landing page shows farewell notification for 8 seconds

## Error Handling

- Invalid password → "Invalid password" error
- Wrong confirmation text → "Please type DELETE to confirm"
- Rate limit exceeded → Shows retry time
- Service unavailable → Generic error message
- Network errors → Caught and displayed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Deletion Approach
The implementation successfully deletes all user data:
1. **Authentication record** - Deleted from auth.users (confirmed working)
2. **User data tables** - All records deleted via direct table operations:
   - `profiles` - User profile information
   - `user_credits` - Credit balance
   - `audiobook_projects` - All user projects
   - `file_uploads` - File metadata
   - `usage_logs` - Usage history
3. **File system** - All audio files automatically cleaned up
4. **Cascading deletes** - Database relationships ensure complete cleanup

### Deletion Verification
The deletion process logs each step:
- Number of projects deleted
- Number of file records deleted
- Number of usage logs deleted
- Credits and profile deletion status
- File system cleanup results

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Confirmation**
   - Send confirmation email after deletion
   - Include deletion timestamp
   - Provide support contact

2. **Grace Period**
   - Optional 30-day recovery period
   - Soft delete initially
   - Permanent deletion after grace period

3. **Data Export**
   - Option to export data before deletion
   - Include all projects and settings
   - Compliance with data portability

## Recent Improvements (July 18, 2025)

### Enhanced User Experience Updates

#### 1. Field-Specific Error Messages
- **Implementation**: Added dedicated error divs below password and confirmation inputs
- **Features**:
  - Red error text appears directly below the invalid field
  - Input field gets red border with shake animation
  - Errors clear automatically when user starts typing
  - Matches login form error style for consistency

#### 2. Loading State Management
- **Problem Fixed**: Loading overlay was showing even for validation errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Client-side validation happens BEFORE showing loading
  - Loading overlay only appears when making actual API call
  - No more "flash" of loading for wrong password
  - Immediate error feedback without processing delay

#### 3. Rate Limiting Protection
- **Client-Side Protection**:
  - 5-second cooldown between deletion attempts
  - Prevents button spam and multiple rapid submissions
  - Shows countdown message: "Please wait X seconds before trying again"
  - `isDeleting` flag prevents concurrent deletion attempts
  
#### 4. Success Notification
- **Landing Page Integration**:
  - Redirect includes `?deleted=true` query parameter
  - Landing page checks for this parameter on load
  - Shows 8-second success notification: "Your account has been successfully deleted. Thank you for using AudioBook Organizer!"
  - URL is cleaned after showing notification to prevent re-display

#### 5. OAuth User Support (July 18, 2025 - Latest)
- **Problem Solved**: OAuth users (Google sign-in) don't have passwords to verify deletion
- **Solution**: OAuth users confirm deletion with their email address instead
- **Implementation**:
  - Frontend detects OAuth users via `user_metadata` checks
  - Shows email input field instead of password field for OAuth users
  - Backend accepts both password and email verification
  - All other behaviors (loading, errors, rate limiting) remain identical

### Technical Implementation Details

#### State Management
```javascript
class ProfileModal {
    constructor() {
        // ... existing properties
        this.isDeleting = false; // Prevent multiple deletion attempts
        this.lastDeleteAttempt = 0; // Track last attempt timestamp
    }
}
```

#### Validation Flow
```javascript
// 1. Client-side validation (no loading)
if (confirmation !== 'DELETE') {
    this.showConfirmationError('Please type DELETE in capital letters to confirm.');
    return; // No loading shown
}

if (!password.trim()) {
    this.showPasswordError('Password is required.');
    return; // No loading shown
}

// 2. Only show loading for actual API call
this.showDeleteAccountLoading();
```

#### Error Styling
```css
.delete-account-modal .form-error {
    color: var(--error-color, #dc3545);
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    margin-top: 0.25rem;
    display: none;
    animation: errorSlideIn 0.3s ease;
}

.delete-account-modal .form-control.is-invalid {
    border-color: var(--error-color, #dc3545);
    animation: shake 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

### OAuth User Detection
```javascript
isOAuthUser() {
    const user = window.sessionManager?.user;
    // Check multiple locations for OAuth indicators:
    // 1. app_metadata.provider
    // 2. user_metadata (provider_id, iss, picture)
    // 3. identities array
    // 4. app_metadata.providers array
}
```

### Backend OAuth Handling
```python
if is_oauth_user:
    # Verify email matches account email
    if email.lower() != user_email.lower():
        return jsonify({
            'error': 'Authentication failed',
            'message': 'Email does not match'
        }), 401
else:
    # Regular password verification for non-OAuth users
    auth_result = supabase_service.sign_in_with_password(user_email, password)
```

## How to Verify Deletion

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Authentication → Users (user should be gone)
   - Table Editor → Check each table:
     - `profiles` - No records for user
     - `user_credits` - No records for user
     - `audiobook_projects` - No projects for user
     - `file_uploads` - No file records
     - `usage_logs` - No usage logs

2. **Check Server Logs**:
   - Look for deletion confirmation messages
   - Each table deletion is logged with count
   - File cleanup results are logged

3. **Check File System**:
   - Verify `uploads` folder has no user files
   - Audio files are automatically removed
