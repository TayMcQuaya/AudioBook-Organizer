# Profile Modal Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. üî• **Credit Purchases Not Appearing in History** 
**Problem**: Purchased credits were showing in the current balance but not in the credit history tab.

**Root Cause**: Stripe payment processing was only recording transactions in the `credit_transactions` table but not logging them in the `usage_logs` table where the profile modal looks for history data.

**Solution**: Modified `backend/services/stripe_service.py` to also log credit purchases in the `usage_logs` table when processing successful payments.

**Changes Made**:
```python
# Added in stripe_service.py process_payment_success method
supabase_service.log_usage(
    user_id=user_id,
    action='credit_purchase',
    credits_used=credits_to_add,  # Positive value for purchases
    metadata={
        'package_type': package_type,
        'amount_cents': session.get('amount_total'),
        'currency': session.get('currency', 'USD'),
        'stripe_session_id': session_id,
        'stripe_payment_intent_id': session.get('payment_intent'),
        'transaction_type': 'purchase'
    }
)
```

### 2. üé® **Dark Theme Appearing Despite Light Mode**
**Problem**: Profile modal was showing dark theme colors even when the app was set to light mode.

**Root Cause**: The modal CSS was using CSS variables without proper fallback values and wasn't correctly inheriting theme context.

**Solution**: 
1. Added explicit CSS variable definitions with fallback values
2. Implemented proper dark/light theme support based on `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute
3. Removed conflicting `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rules

**Changes Made**:
```css
.profile-modal {
    /* Force light theme variables as default */
    --bg-primary: #ffffff;
    --bg-secondary: #f7fafc;
    --text-primary: #2d3748;
    --text-secondary: #4a5568;
    /* ... more variables */
}

/* Dark theme support */
[data-theme="dark"] .profile-modal {
    --bg-primary: #1a202c;
    --bg-secondary: #2d3748;
    --text-primary: #f7fafc;
    --text-secondary: #a0aec0;
    /* ... dark theme variables */
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Frontend Testing
1. **Login** to your account
2. **Open the Profile modal** (click the Profile button)
3. **Check Credit History tab**:
   - Credit purchases should now appear with green `+` values
   - Filter by "Credit Purchase" to see only purchases
4. **Check Theme Consistency**:
   - Toggle between light/dark theme in the app
   - Profile modal should respect the current theme setting

### Backend Testing
Run the test script to verify backend functionality:
```bash
cd "test files"
python test_profile_modal_fixes.py
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ Authentication status
- ‚úÖ Profile data retrieval
- ‚úÖ Usage history endpoint (should show credit purchases)
- ‚úÖ Credits balance endpoint
- ‚úÖ Stripe transaction history

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå Credit purchases missing from history tab
- ‚ùå Modal appearing in dark theme despite light mode setting
- ‚ùå Inconsistent theme behavior

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Credit purchases appear in history with green `+` values
- ‚úÖ Modal respects current theme setting (light/dark)
- ‚úÖ Consistent theme behavior across the app
- ‚úÖ Purchase filter works correctly
- ‚úÖ Proper credit display formatting

## Future Purchases

All **new credit purchases** made through Stripe will automatically appear in both:
1. **Current Balance** (as before)
2. **Credit History** (now fixed!)

## Debug Information

The profile modal now includes console logging for purchases:
```javascript
console.log(`Found credit purchase in history: ${credits} credits on ${date}`, entry);
```

Check your browser's developer console when viewing the Credit History tab to see if purchases are being detected.

## Technical Details

### Database Tables Involved:
- `user_credits` - Stores current credit balance
- `usage_logs` - Stores all usage/purchase history (used by profile modal)
- `credit_transactions` - Stores Stripe transaction details

### API Endpoints:
- `/api/auth/usage-history` - Returns paginated usage history
- `/api/auth/credits` - Returns current credit balance
- `/api/auth/profile` - Returns user profile information

### Files Modified:
1. `backend/services/stripe_service.py` - Added usage logging for purchases
2. `frontend/css/profile-modal.css` - Fixed theme support
3. `frontend/js/modules/profileModal.js` - Improved purchase display logic
4. `test files/test_profile_modal_fixes.py` - New test script

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Both issues resolved and ready for testing!
