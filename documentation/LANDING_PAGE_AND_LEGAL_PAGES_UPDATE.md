    requiresAuth: false,
    layout: 'landing'
},
'/terms': {
    title: 'Terms of Service - AudioBook Organizer',
    component: 'terms',
    requiresAuth: false,
    layout: 'landing'
},
'/contact': {
    title: 'Contact Us - AudioBook Organizer',
    component: 'contact',
    requiresAuth: false,
    layout: 'landing'
}
```

### Load Functions Added
- `loadPrivacyPage()` - Fetches and initializes privacy page

- **User experience**: Immediate feedback when wrong format uploaded

## 5. Implementation Details

### Following PAGE_LIFECYCLE_GUIDE.md
All new pages implement:
1. **Container detection pattern** for smooth transitions
2. **Init function** for page initialization
3. **Cleanup function** for resource cleanup
4. **Authentication checking** from multiple sources
5. **Event listener management**

### Styling Consistency
- Reused existing CSS variables for theming
- Consistent navigation and footer across pages
- Responsive design matching existing patterns

### Placeholder Content
- Legal pages contain placeholder text with clear instructions
- Contact form includes setup instructions for backend integration
- All placeholders clearly marked for easy identification

## 6. Future Considerations

### Contact Form Backend
The contact form requires backend implementation:
1. Create endpoint at `/api/contact`
2. Configure email service (SMTP, SendGrid, etc.)
3. Update form submission handler
4. Add rate limiting and validation

### Legal Content
- Replace placeholder legal text with actual policies
- Consider consulting legal counsel for proper terms
- Update last modified dates when content changes

### Digital Ocean Deployment
- All pages designed to work as single app instance
- No external dependencies requiring separate hosting
- Router handles all navigation client-side

## 7. Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to each new page via footer links
2. Test router navigation between pages
3. Verify theme switching works on all pages
4. Check responsive design on mobile devices
5. Test authentication state updates

### File Upload Testing
1. Try uploading supported formats (.txt, .docx)
2. Try uploading unsupported formats (PDF, DOC, etc.)
3. Verify error messages are clear and helpful
