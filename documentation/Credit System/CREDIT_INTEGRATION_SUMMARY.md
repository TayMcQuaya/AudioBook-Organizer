# Credit System Integration Summary

## üéØ **Integration Completed Successfully**

The credit system has been successfully integrated into normal mode without affecting testing mode functionality. All routes now properly enforce authentication and credit requirements in production while maintaining unlimited credits simulation in testing mode.

**‚úÖ LATEST UPDATE:** Text file (.txt) upload credit enforcement has been successfully implemented and tested. TXT files now properly consume 3 credits through backend processing, closing a critical security vulnerability where text files were processed entirely on the frontend without authentication or credit consumption.

## üîß **Backend Changes Made**

### **1. Route Authentication Updates**
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/upload_routes.py` - Audio upload + **NEW TXT upload endpoint** ‚úÖ
- `backend/routes/export_routes.py` 
- `backend/routes/docx_routes.py`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `@require_temp_auth` decorators with dynamic authentication
- Added credit checking before operations (normal mode only)
- Added credit consumption after successful operations
- Preserved testing mode behavior with session-based auth
- Added comprehensive error handling for insufficient credits
- **NEW:** Implemented `/api/upload/txt` endpoint with proper auth and credit enforcement

### **2. Authentication Logic**
**Pattern Implemented:**
```python
# Check mode and apply appropriate authentication
if current_app.config.get('TESTING_MODE'):
    # Testing mode: check session authentication
    if not session.get('temp_authenticated'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Authentication required'}), 401
else:
    # Normal mode: JWT auth + credit enforcement
    token = extract_token_from_header()
    user = supabase_service.get_user_from_token(token)
    current_credits = supabase_service.get_user_credits(user['id'])
    if current_credits < required_credits:
        return 402 # Payment Required
```

### **3. Credit Enforcement**
**Normal Mode:**
- Pre-flight credit checks before processing
- Credit consumption after successful operations
- Usage logging with detailed metadata
- Proper error responses for insufficient credits

**Testing Mode:**
- Session-based authentication preserved
- Credit simulation without actual deduction
- All functionality works with unlimited credits
- Credit usage tracking for UX testing

## üé® **Frontend Changes Made**

### **1. TXT File Upload Security Fix** ‚úÖ
**File Modified:** `frontend/js/modules/bookUpload.js`

**Critical Security Issue Resolved:**
- **Before:** TXT files processed entirely on frontend (no auth, no credits)
- **After:** TXT files sent to backend `/api/upload/txt` endpoint
- **Security:** Requires authentication and consumes 3 credits
- **Testing:** Successfully verified credit consumption in production

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// New backend processing for TXT files
const result = await processTextFile(file);
text = result.text;
metadata = result.metadata;
```

### **2. Landing Page Credit Display**
**File Modified:** `frontend/pages/landing/landing.js`

**Changes:**
- Added credit display initialization for authenticated users
- Credit display appears in navigation when logged in
- Proper cleanup when user signs out
- Seamless integration with existing UI

```javascript
// Added to updateLandingPageForAuthenticatedUser()
import('../../js/modules/appUI.js').then(module => {
    module.initializeCreditsDisplay();
    console.log('üíé Credit display initialized for authenticated user on landing page');
});
```

### **3. Credit Display Integration**
**Behavior:**
- **Landing Page:** Credits shown for authenticated users
- **App Page:** Credits shown as before
- **Testing Mode:** Shows simulated credits (localStorage)
- **Normal Mode:** Shows real credits from database
- **TXT Upload:** Credit display refreshes after successful TXT file processing

---

## üîí **Security & Authentication**

### **Testing Mode (TESTING_MODE=true)**
- **Authentication:** Session-based (`temp_authenticated`)
- **Credits:** Unlimited (999999) with simulation
- **Usage:** Development and testing only
- **Credit Tracking:** Simulated for UX testing

### **Normal Mode (TESTING_MODE=false)**
- **Authentication:** JWT-based Supabase auth
- **Credits:** Real database credits with enforcement
- **Usage:** Production deployment
- **Credit Tracking:** Full audit trail in database

---

## üì° **API Endpoints**

### **Credit Management**
- `GET /api/auth/credits` - Get user's current credit balance ‚úÖ
- Credit enforcement integrated into existing endpoints:
  - `POST /api/upload` - Audio upload (2 credits) ‚úÖ
  - `POST /api/upload/txt` - **NEW** Text file upload (3 credits) ‚úÖ
  - `POST /api/upload/docx` - DOCX processing (5 credits) ‚úÖ
  - `POST /api/export` - Export operations (0-15 credits) ‚úÖ

### **Authentication Endpoints**
- All existing auth endpoints preserved ‚úÖ
- Credit balance included in user data ‚úÖ
- New user initialization with starting credits (100) ‚úÖ

---

## üß™ **Mode Switching Behavior**

### **Environment Variable Control**
```bash
# Testing Mode
TESTING_MODE=true
TEMPORARY_PASSWORD=your_test_password

# Normal Mode  
TESTING_MODE=false
SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_production_key
```

### **Dynamic Behavior**
- **Testing Mode:** Session auth + unlimited credits + credit simulation

## üéõÔ∏è **Configurable Credit Costs (NEW)**

### **Environment Variable Control**
Credit costs are now configurable via environment variables without requiring code changes:

```bash
# Credit costs (change these values as needed)
CREDIT_COST_AUDIO_UPLOAD=2          # Currently: 2 credits
CREDIT_COST_TXT_UPLOAD=3             # Currently: 3 credits
CREDIT_COST_DOCX_PROCESSING=5        # Currently: 5 credits  
CREDIT_COST_PREMIUM_EXPORT=15        # Currently: 15 credits
```

### **Implementation Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **No Code Changes Needed** - Update costs instantly via environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Zero Downtime** - Change costs without redeploying code
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible** - Falls back to original hardcoded values if not set
- ‚úÖ **Production Safe** - All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **Testing Friendly** - Can test different pricing scenarios easily

### **How to Change Credit Costs**

**Digital Ocean Backend:**
1. Update environment variables in your app settings
2. Restart the application (takes ~30 seconds)
3. New costs take effect immediately

**Example Environment Variables:**
```bash
CREDIT_COST_AUDIO_UPLOAD=2           # Increase audio upload cost
CREDIT_COST_DOCX_PROCESSING=5        # Increase DOCX processing cost
CREDIT_COST_PREMIUM_EXPORT=20        # Increase premium export cost
```

### **Files Modified**
- ‚úÖ `backend/config.py` - Added credit cost configuration
- ‚úÖ `backend/routes/upload_routes.py` - Uses configurable audio upload cost + NEW TXT upload endpoint
- ‚úÖ `backend/routes/docx_routes.py` - Uses configurable DOCX processing cost
- ‚úÖ `backend/routes/export_routes.py` - Uses configurable premium export cost
- ‚úÖ `frontend/js/modules/bookUpload.js` - NEW backend credit enforcement for TXT files
- ‚úÖ `env.example` - Added example credit cost variables

### **Security & Best Practices**
- **Not Security Sensitive** - These are business logic values, not secrets
- **Environment Variable Best Practice** - Perfect use case for configuration
- **Fallback Values** - Code includes safe defaults if env vars not set
- **Production Ready** - Safe to deploy to production immediately
