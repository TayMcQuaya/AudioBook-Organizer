# Browser Cache Issue - Credits & Project Restoration Fix

## Problem Encountered
After implementing fixes for session token retrieval timing issues, the application still failed to:
- Display credits after page refresh/navigation
- Restore projects after page refresh/navigation

## Root Cause
**Browser was serving cached JavaScript modules** instead of the updated code with our fixes.

## Symptoms
- Logs showed authentication working correctly
- Credits fetch calls were made but never completed
- Project restoration stuck at "ðŸ”„ Attempting to restore latest project..."
- API calls appeared to hang with no response logs

## Solution
**Hard refresh or incognito mode** was needed to bypass cached modules.

## Why This Happened
1. Our fixes were in JavaScript modules (`auth.js`, `appUI.js`, `storage.js`)
2. Browser aggressively caches ES6 modules for performance
3. Regular refresh (F5) doesn't always clear module cache
4. Changes to authentication/API logic weren't being loaded

## Prevention & Solutions

### For Development:
1. **Hard Refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Incognito Mode**: Always works as it starts with clean cache
3. **Developer Tools**: Open DevTools â†’ Network tab â†’ check "Disable cache"
4. **Clear Storage**: DevTools â†’ Application tab â†’ Clear Storage

### For Production:
1. **Cache Busting**: Add version numbers to module imports
2. **Service Worker**: Implement proper cache invalidation
3. **Headers**: Set appropriate cache headers for JS modules

### Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Check if server is responding
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/credits

# Force refresh in most browsers
Ctrl+Shift+R

# Open incognito/private window
Ctrl+Shift+N (Chrome/Edge) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Firefox)
```

## Lesson Learned
When debugging frontend issues after code changes:
1. **Always try incognito mode first** to rule out caching
2. Check browser DevTools â†’ Network tab for 304 responses (cached)
3. Modern SPAs with ES6 modules are especially prone to this
4. Authentication/session fixes are particularly affected since they modify core module behavior
