# Mobile Testing Guide for AudioBook Organizer

## 🚀 Testing on Your Mobile Device

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

The server is configured to accept connections from external devices (0.0.0.0:3000).

### 2. Find Your Computer's IP Address

#### On Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

#### On Mac/Linux:
```bash
ifconfig
```
Look for "inet" address under your active network interface

### 3. Access from Mobile Device

1. Ensure your mobile device is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
2. Open your mobile browser
3. Navigate to: `http://[YOUR-COMPUTER-IP]:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

### 4. Troubleshooting

#### If you can't connect:

1. **Check Windows Firewall**
   - Windows Security > Firewall & network protection
   - Allow an app > Python (or your specific Python executable)
   - Make sure it's allowed on Private networks

2. **Check if server is running correctly**
   - Should show: `Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)`
   - Should show: `Running on http://0.0.0.0:3000`

3. **Try using your computer's hostname**
   - Some networks work better with: `http://[COMPUTER-NAME].local:3000`

## 🔧 Configuration Note

The Flask server is configured with:

- **Production**: Already uses `0.0.0.0` (no changes needed)

This configuration is safe for local development and doesn't affect production deployments.
