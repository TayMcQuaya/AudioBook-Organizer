# Credit Configuration Fix - Complete

## Summary
Fixed the issue where credit costs were hardcoded in the frontend and not using environment variables. Also fixed credit display caching issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Added Credit Costs to Config API
Modified `/backend/routes/auth_routes.py` to include credit costs in the config endpoint:
```python
'credit_costs': {
    'audio_upload': Config.CREDIT_COST_AUDIO_UPLOAD,
    'txt_upload': Config.CREDIT_COST_TXT_UPLOAD,
    'docx_processing': Config.CREDIT_COST_DOCX_PROCESSING,
    'premium_export': Config.CREDIT_COST_PREMIUM_EXPORT
}
```

### 2. Frontend - Created Credit Configuration Module
Created `/frontend/js/modules/creditConfig.js` to manage credit costs dynamically:
- Fetches credit costs from backend on initialization
- Provides getter functions for credit costs
- Falls back to defaults if backend is unavailable

### 3. Frontend - Updated All Credit Cost References
Updated the following files to use dynamic credit costs:
- `export.js`: Premium export cost now uses `getCreditCost('premium_export')`
- `ui.js`: Low credits modal now shows dynamic costs from backend
- `bookUpload.js`: TXT upload check now uses `getCreditCost('txt_upload')`

### 4. Frontend - Fixed Credit Display Caching
Modified `appUI.js` to:
- Always force refresh credits on first attempt (to avoid stale cache)
- Use the existing `forceRefresh` parameter in `getUserCredits()`
- This ensures credits show current values after navigation/refresh

### 5. Frontend - Added Credit Config Initialization
Modified `appInitialization.js` to:
- Import and initialize credit configuration on app start
- Logs success/failure of credit cost loading

## Testing the Fix

1. **Backend API Test**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/config
   ```
   Should return credit_costs in the response.

2. **Frontend Console Check**:
   After app loads, you should see:
   ```
   ðŸ’Ž Credit costs loaded from backend: {audio_upload: 2, txt_upload: 3, ...}
   ```

3. **Dynamic Cost Display**:
   - Open the low credits modal
   - Costs should match your environment variables

4. **Credit Refresh Test**:
   - Upload a file or perform an action that uses credits
   - Credits should update immediately without caching issues
   - Refresh the page - credits should show current value

## Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
```
CREDIT_COST_AUDIO_UPLOAD=2
CREDIT_COST_TXT_UPLOAD=3
CREDIT_COST_DOCX_PROCESSING=5
CREDIT_COST_PREMIUM_EXPORT=15
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Centralized Configuration**: Credit costs are now managed in one place (environment variables)
2. **No More Hardcoding**: Frontend dynamically fetches costs from backend
3. **Easier Updates**: Change credit costs without modifying code
4. **Better Caching**: Credits always show current values, no stale cache issues
5. **Consistent Costs**: Frontend and backend use the same values

## Implementation Notes
- Credit costs are loaded once during app initialization
- If backend is unavailable, sensible defaults are used
- Force refresh is automatic on first credit fetch to avoid cache issues
- The `_creditRefreshNeeded` flag still works for forcing updates after operations
